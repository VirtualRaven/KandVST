# How to contribute to FRUT?

Contributions to FRUT are very welcomed and you can contribute even if you don't know
anything about CMake.


## Just do it!

You can simply convert your existing JUCE projects using `Jucer2Reprojucer` and build them
using CMake (see https://github.com/McMartin/FRUT#getting-started). Then create issues
(https://github.com/McMartin/FRUT/issues/new) to report any unwanted differences with how
your projects are usually built when using Projucer.


## Show your interest

Several existing issues are labeled ["missing feature"][missing-feature-issues] and are
only waiting for you to comment on them to express your interest for these features. If
FRUT is missing another feature that you need and there is no issue for that feature, feel
free to create one!


## Help needed

Some of the issues are also labeled ["help wanted"][help-wanted-issues] because they
concern features that require acquiring third-party SDKs and tools. We need developers who
are familiar with these SDKs and tools to build and test theirs JUCE projects while we are
adding these features to FRUT.

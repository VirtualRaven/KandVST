# FRUT

`FRUT` is a collection of tools dedicated to building [JUCE][juce] projects using
[CMake][cmake] instead of [Projucer][projucer].

It currently contains:

- `Reprojucer.cmake`, a CMake module that provides high-level functions to reproduce how a
JUCE project is defined in Projucer,

- `Jucer2Reprojucer`, a console application based on JUCE that converts `.jucer` project
files into `CMakeLists.txt` files that include and use `Reprojucer.cmake`,

- several `CMakeLists.txt` files generated from existing `.jucer` project files,
including:

  - `examples` and `extras` projects from [JUCE 4.2.0][github-juce-4.2.0] (in
[generated/JUCE-4.2.0](generated/JUCE-4.2.0))

  - `examples` and `extras` projects from [JUCE 4.3.1][github-juce-4.3.1] (in
[generated/JUCE-4.3.1](generated/JUCE-4.3.1))

  - `examples` and `extras` projects from [JUCE 5.0.0][github-juce-5.0.0] (in
[generated/JUCE-5.0.0](generated/JUCE-5.0.0))

  - `examples` and `extras` projects from [JUCE 5.2.0][github-juce-5.2.0] (in
[generated/JUCE-5.2.0](generated/JUCE-5.2.0))


## Requirements

- CMake, version 3.4 minimum
- JUCE, version 4.2.0 minimum (JUCE 5 support is experimental)


## Getting started

Let's consider that you have a copy of [JUCE][github-juce], a copy of [FRUT][github-frut]
and a JUCE project called `MyGreatProject` following this folder structure:

        <root>
        ├── FRUT/
        ├── JUCE/
        └── MyGreatProject/
            ├── Source/
            └── MyGreatProject.jucer

We first build `Jucer2Reprojucer` with CMake. Since `Jucer2Reprojucer` uses the JUCE
modules `juce_core`, `juce_data_structures` and `juce_events`, we specify where to find
JUCE by defining `JUCE_ROOT` when calling `cmake`.

    $ cd <root>/FRUT/Jucer2Reprojucer/

    $ mkdir build && cd build/

    $ cmake .. -DJUCE_ROOT=../../../JUCE
    ...
    -- Configuring done
    -- Generating done
    -- Build files have been written to: <root>/FRUT/Jucer2Reprojucer/build

    $ cmake --build .
    ...

Then we convert `MyGreatProject.jucer` to a new `CMakeLists.txt` file:

    $ cd <root>/MyGreatProject/

    $ ../FRUT/Jucer2Reprojucer/build(/Debug)/Jucer2Reprojucer MyGreatProject.jucer ../FRUT/cmake/Reprojucer.cmake

    <root>/MyGreatProject/CMakeLists.txt has been successfully generated.

Now we can build `MyGreatProject` using CMake:

    $ cd <root>/MyGreatProject/

    $ mkdir build && cd build/

    $ cmake .. -G<generator> -DMyGreatProject_jucer_FILE=../MyGreatProject.jucer
    ...
    -- Configuring done
    -- Generating done
    -- Build files have been written to: <root>/MyGreatProject/build

    $ cmake --build .
    ...

`<generator>` can be one of many [CMake Generators][cmake-generators] supported by your
platform, including Ninja, NMake Makefiles (on Windows only), Unix Makefiles (on Linux and
macOS), Visual Studio 2013, 2015 and 2017 (on Windows only), and Xcode (on macOS only).


## Supported export targets

`Reprojucer.cmake` and `Jucer2Reprojucer` support the following Projucer export targets:
- Xcode (MacOSX)
- Visual Studio 2017
- Visual Studio 2015
- Visual Studio 2013
- Linux Makefile

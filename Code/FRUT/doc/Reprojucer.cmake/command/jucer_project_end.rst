jucer_project_end
=================

Indicate the end of a JUCE project.

::

  jucer_project_end()

This command creates the targets (executable, library, plugin, ...) based on the settings
specified by the other `jucer_* commands <../README.rst#commands>`_. Thus you should call
this command last.
